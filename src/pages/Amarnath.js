          <h2>About Amarnath Temple</h2>
          <p>Amarnath Temple is a Hindu shrine located in Anantnag district of Jammu and Kashmir, India. A cave situated at an altitude of 3,888 m (12,756 ft), about 168 km from Anantnag city, the district headquarters, 141 km (88 mi) from Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, reached through Pahalgam town.</p>
          <p>The shrine represents an important part of Hinduism. The cave, located in Lidder Valley, is surrounded by glaciers, snowy mountains and is covered with snow most of the year, except for a short period in the summer, when it is open to pilgrims. In 1989, pilgrims numbered between 12,000 and 30,000. In 2011, the numbers reached a peak, crossing 6.3 lakh (630,000) pilgrims. In 2018 pilgrims numbered 2.85 lakh (285,000). The annual pilgrimage has varied between 20 and 60 days.</p>
          <p>The Amarnath cave, abode of the Mahamaya Shakti Peetha, is one of the 51 Shakti Peethas, temples on the Indian Subcontinent that commemorate the location of fallen body parts of the Hindu deity Sati.</p>

          <h2>The Sacred Shiva Linga</h2>
          <p>The Shiva Lingam at the shrine is a Swayambhu lingam. The lingam is a natural stalagmite formation inside a 40 m (130 ft) tall cave at an elevation of 3,888 m (12,756 ft) on the Amarnath Mountain, which has a peak of 5,186 metres (17,014 ft).</p>

          <p>The stalagmite is formed due to the freezing of water drops that fall from the roof of the cave onto the floor, resulting in an upward growth of an ice formation. Here, the stalagmites considered as the lingam, a physical manifestation of Shiva, form a solid-dome-shape. Two smaller stalagmites are thought to represent Parvati and Ganesha.</p>
          <p>According to the ancient Hindu texts of the Mahabharata and Puranas a lingam represents Shiva. The lingam waxes during May to August, as snow melts in the Himalayas above the cave, and water seeps into the rocks of the cave; thereafter, the lingam gradually wanes. Religious beliefs hold that the lingam grows and shrinks with the phases of the moon, reaching its height during the summer festival.</p>

          <h2>History</h2>
          <h3>Ancient History</h3>
          <p>The book Rajatarangini (Book VII v. 183) refers to Krishaanth or Amarnath. It is believed that in the 11th century CE, Queen Suryamati gifted trishulas, banalingas and other sacred emblems to this temple. Rajavalipataka, begun by Prajna Bhatta, contains detailed references to the pilgrimage to Amarnath Cave Temple. In addition, there are further references to this pilgrimage in many other ancient texts.</p>
          
          <h3>Medieval History</h3>
          <p>The cave and the Shivling finds mention in Abu'l Fazl's 16th century work Ain-i-Akbari. According to him, the site attracted many pilgrims. He describes the waxing and waning of the lingam according to the seasons and the moon. François Bernier, a French physician, accompanied Emperor Aurangzeb during his visit to Kashmir in 1663. In his book Travels in Mughal Empire, he provides an account of the places he visited, noting that he was "pursuing journey to a grotto full of wonderful congelations, two days journey from Sangsafed" when he "received intelligence that my Nawab felt very impatient and uneasy on account of my long absence."</p>

          <h3>Modern History</h3>
          <p>In 1895, pilgrims would first travel to Kheer Bhawani for a brief stop. Sustained by free rations from the state, the pilgrims would then travel to Srinagar. From Srinagar, in batches, the pilgrims would then head up Lidder Valley, stopping at locations for holy dips. At Mach Bawan, local Hindus would join them. Maliks of Batok were responsible for the route during these years. Sister Nivedita, in Notes of Some Wanderings with the Swami Vivekananda, writes of Swami Vivekananda's visit to the cave in 1898.</p>

          <h2>The Sacred Journey - Amarnath Yatra</h2>
          <p>The annual pilgrimage to Amarnath is one of the most sacred journeys in Hinduism. The yatra typically takes place during the months of July and August, coinciding with the Hindu month of Shravan. Pilgrims undertake this challenging journey through treacherous mountain paths, braving extreme weather conditions to seek the divine blessings of Lord Shiva.</p>
          <p>The journey begins from Pahalgam or Baltal, with pilgrims walking through beautiful valleys, crossing rivers, and climbing steep mountain passes. The route is dotted with langars (community kitchens) and medical camps to support the pilgrims.</p>

          <h2>Spiritual Significance</h2>
          <p>Amarnath holds immense spiritual significance as it is believed to be the place where Lord Shiva revealed the secret of immortality (Amar Katha) to Goddess Parvati. The cave represents the eternal nature of Shiva and the cycle of creation and destruction.</p>
          <p>According to legend, when Lord Shiva was narrating the secret of immortality to Parvati, a pair of doves overheard the conversation. These doves are said to have become immortal and can still be seen in the cave, symbolizing the eternal nature of the knowledge imparted here.</p>

          <h2>Best Time to Visit</h2>
          <p>The best time to visit Amarnath Temple is during the annual yatra period, which usually falls between July and August. The cave is accessible only during this time when the snow melts and the path becomes navigable. The weather during this period is relatively mild, though still challenging due to the high altitude.</p>
          <p>It's important to note that the yatra is subject to weather conditions and security considerations. Pilgrims are advised to check the official announcements and register for the yatra through the official channels.</p>
